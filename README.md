# Workflow Execution Monetization Starter Kit

**Turn your automation workflows into revenue streams. Sell executions, not templates.**

***

## What This Is

A complete frontend infrastructure for monetizing workflow executions built with n8n, Make, or any automation platform. Instead of selling workflow templates (one-time downloads), this enables you to sell **per-execution access** to your automations.

**Built from 18+ months of production experience** running a workflow monetization service. This is the exact infrastructure used to handle thousands of workflow executions with built-in anti-abuse, payment validation, and user management.

## The Problem This Solves

You've built powerful workflows in n8n/Make/Zapier. Now what?

**Existing options:**
- ‚ùå Sell workflow templates on marketplaces (one-time payment, customer runs it themselves)
- ‚ùå Offer consulting services (doesn't scale, high-touch)
- ‚ùå Build SaaS from scratch (months of work, complex infrastructure)

**What you actually need:**
- ‚úÖ Frontend to accept workflow execution requests
- ‚úÖ Payment processing with credit systems
- ‚úÖ Anti-abuse measures (VPN detection, trial limits)
- ‚úÖ Webhook integration with your workflows
- ‚úÖ Professional user experience with state management

**This starter kit provides all of that, production-tested and ready to customize.**
